# TodoApp - MegaK Final Project

## TodoApp is a task manager written as a final project for the MegaK course. The application allows users to add, delete, edit, and mark tasks as completed.

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to TodoApp â€“ my brainchild from the MegaK course! ðŸš€ It's not just your run-of-the-mill task manager; it's the culmination of a year's worth of learning and experimenting.

So, what's under the hood? Well, we've got a slick backend dancing to the tunes of Express.js, TypeScript, and Node.js â€“ all in harmony to create those smooth REST APIs. And for the data groove, we're rocking a MySQL database, keeping things organized and snappy.

But wait, there's more! On the frontend, we're strumming the chords of React and TypeScript to create a user interface that's as intuitive as it gets. Adding tasks, deleting them, tweaking titles â€“ it's all a breeze. Oh, and don't forget the sweet satisfaction of marking tasks as done â€“ progress has never been so satisfying!

Ready to dive in? Let's make organizing your tasks a walk in the park. ðŸš€âœ¨

Happy tasking!

##Deployment

- **Frontend**: [https://app-todo-fe.vercel.app/](https://app-todo-fe.vercel.app/)
- **Backend**: [https://todo-app-be-two.vercel.app/](https://todo-app-be-two.vercel.app/)

## Installation

Install my-project with npm and MySQL database:


1. Create MySQL Database:

* Open a MySQL terminal or command prompt window.
* Log in to the MySQL server.
* Run the following command to create the database:
```bash
  CREATE DATABASE todo;
```
*Run the following command to create the todos table:
```bash
  CREATE TABLE `todo`.`todos` (
    `id` VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL DEFAULT uuid() COLLATE 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci',
    `title` VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL COLLATE 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci',
    `date` DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),
    `isDone` TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
    `description` VARCHAR(255) NULL DEFAULT NULL COLLATE 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci',
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`) USING BTREE
);
```

* Once the database and table have been created, you can start the frontend and backend applications as instructed further on. 

2. Clone the project to your local machine.
- Open a terminal or command prompt window.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
- Run the following command to clone TodoApp repository: 

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/GregorySVD/TodoApp
```
3. Start Frontend [FE]:

- Move to frontend folder - type in terminal or command prompt window: 
```bash
  cd .\TodoApp\frontend\     
```
- Install the required dependencies:
```bash
  npm install 
```
- Run the following command to start Frontend:
```bash
  npm run start
```
3. Start Backend [BE]:
- Move to backend folder - if You are still in [FE] folder, type in terminal or command prompt window:
```bash
  cd ..\backend\
```
- Install the required dependencies:
```bash
  npm install 
```
- Run the following command to start Backend:
```bash
  npm run start
```

## Features
- Adding Tasks: Users can add new tasks by specifying their titles.
- Removing Tasks: Tasks can be deleted, allowing for cleaning up the task list.

  ## Next Steps

**User Authentication**

- Implement user registration and login functionality using a secure authentication system.
- Allow users to create and manage their own accounts.

**Task Sharing**

- Enable users to share their Todo lists with other users.
- Implement a permissions system to control who can view and edit shared lists.

**Theme Persistence**

- Store the user's preferred theme in cookies for persistent usage.
- Automatically apply the saved theme when the user revisits the application.

**Drag-and-Drop Functionality**

- Implement drag-and-drop functionality to allow users to easily reorder tasks within their lists.
- Provide visual feedback during the drag-and-drop operation to enhance user experience.

**Task Prioritization**

- Introduce a task prioritization system to enable users to assign priority levels to their tasks.
- Visualize task priorities using different colors or icons for easy identification.

**Known Issues Resolution**

- Address the 'Identity Crisis' issue by standardizing the naming convention for tasks across the backend and frontend.
- Refactor the code to separate the Contact and About components into their own dedicated pages.
- Implement task descriptions to allow users to add and view detailed descriptions for each task.
- Organize the project files to improve code structure and maintainability.
- Resolve the Navbar layout dilemma by conducting user research and evaluating the most effective placement for the Navbar component.

## Known issues 
Hey, we're all a work in progress, right? Here are a few quirks in TodoApp that I'm aware of. Blame it on the ticking clock â€“ this is still the beta version, and I promise I'll iron out the kinks soon!

1. Identity Crisis:

Backend vs. Frontend: So, the backend is rocking 'Todo' as the cool name for variables, while the frontend is vibing with 'Task.' It's like they're speaking different languages. Lost in translation, you know?

2. Router Riddles:

Contact and About Saga: The grand plan was for the 'Contact' and 'About' bookmarks to be these cool separate pages, strutting their stuff with react-router. Well, life got busy, and they ended up as not-so-separate entities displayed as modal. Oops!

3. Task Tales:

Missing Descriptions: Adding tasks is a breeze, but let's be real â€“ a task without a story is like a day without sunshine. Currently, they're a bit shy on the description front. Fear not, though! Soon, they'll spill their tales, and you'll be able to add and view those juicy details.

4. File Frenzy:

Balagan Galore: There's a bit of a mess going on in the project files. It's like a jigsaw puzzle with a few missing pieces. Time constraints got the best of me, and organization took a back seat. But hey, we're all friends here, right? We'll tidy up this digital mess soon.

5. Navbar Nomad:

Layout Dilemma: Now, here's the head-scratcher. The NavBar component is having an identity crisis â€“ should it hang out in the 'layouts' folder, rubbing elbows with others, or is it destined for the solo life in its own folder? Decisions, decisions. Feel free to share your thoughts on this one!
